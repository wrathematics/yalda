What is this?
================================================================================
yalda is Yet Another LDA package for R.  This uses Google's plda package
(serial only at the moment).  This "port" for R is very lazy at the moment 
(look at R/lda.r to get an idea for how it works), and relies on disk IO 
"each way", rather than being fully integrated with R.  Assuming it makes sense
to do so, future versions will have a more fully integrated set of wrappers.
For the moment, consider this a prototype.

As the name implies, this package can be used to fit Latent Dirichlet Allocation
(LDA) models.



How to install
================================================================================
Download the package and issue the usual 

R CMD INSTALL yalda_0.1.tar.gz

and everything should just work.  If it doesn't, please let me know.
